# Append Query Params

This repo is regarding appending the query params in the current browser URL through a CRUD browser extension.

## How it works
User can fill in the key-value pair of required query params in specified input fields given in browser extension and reload the page via `Reload` button. These query params will be remembered by the extension for the future use and will save the time of manually entering the query params in the URL again.
